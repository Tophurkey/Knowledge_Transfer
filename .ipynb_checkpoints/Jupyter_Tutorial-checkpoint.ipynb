Some times this data is a huge pool collected in a data lake for sifting through and other times this data is high velocity with the need to handle and react quickly with one or more sources. ####"

    "#### One of the best aspects of using Jupyter Notebooks to program with python is being able compile your code in blocks that allows you to troubleshoot it as you go and also change each chunk to get the result you want without having to compile the whole code again. The way python does this is through utilization of a Kernel that does the compilation of your code and holds the state through each iteration as you execute a new cell. Think of the kernel as your actual program being hosted by jupyter and each time you update a cell it sends that info back through a socket in json. There's no need to understand how this works to use it but in short this setup allows you to create and edit scripts with ease!\n",
