Some times this data is a huge pool collected in a data lake for sifting through and other times this data is high velocity with the need to handle and react quickly with one or more sources. ####"

Think of the kernel as your actual program being hosted by jupyter and each time you update a cell it sends that info back through a socket in json. There's no need to understand how this works to use it but in short this setup allows you to create and edit scripts with ease!\n",

As a programmer your goal will be how to appropriately articulate real-world problems into something a program can interpret and do. By learning more about what a computer can do hopefully the more problems you can translate into computer code for it to do that problem. Another thing to consider is that some problems may be impossible or extremely difficult for a program to do and are better off being done by a human. For Example: consider a computer that reads a lot of data, organizes that data, and then produces graphs from that data. But should the computer use that data to make a decision on what the business should do with that result? Perhaps the final step is too complicated and may even be based on intuition or a \"gut feeling\" that isn't possible to program (yet!)."
