--Performing a "Select Top 1000" on a Table via Right Click
--We used FST.ProcessRecord in the SensorManufacturing_G7_DEV
--The code this creates is seen below:

SELECT TOP (1000) 
  FROM 
  
 /*
 If needed the "TOP (1000)" can be changed to "TOP (10)" or any other number of rows you would like to limit or expand your view to. 
 The idea is that this would help reduce query time and size when trying to just get a quick snapshot of the data you are looking at. 
 This is a great feature for developing a query and then removing it for running the full developed query.

--Basic SQL Structure

/*
SELECT Statements are where you can specify the columns separated by commas
Which are requested for the results and execute a select few
Functions such as TOP or DISTINCT
*/

SELECT TOP (10) 

/*
The FROM statement is the Pointer on where to pull the Data From
This is the most critical piece as you definitely need to know where
The data you are looking at is coming from and ensure it is the correct
Table you need. Also different tables may have different columns.
This information is in the format of "FROM DatabaseName.SchemaName.TableName"
*/

FROM

/*
The Where Statement is the one which is the most useful for filtering your data
and is usually the one that will become the most verbose. In a WHERE statement you
can joing multiple filters together with boolean statements such as "AND" and "OR".
Most WHERE statements have the format of "WHERE ColumnName like 'Value'"
